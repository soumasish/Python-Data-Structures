# Python 3 Implementation of the commonly used data structures

This project is designed as more of a self-reference. The first part provides a pythonic implementation of the commonly used data structures. The second part goes into using these to solve some of the common problems in data structures and algorithmic interviews. A summary of the problems and the related python file is provided in the table below. Time complexities and brief logic is appended as docstrings wherever I thought there might be a scope of ambiguity.
