## Python 3 implementation of some commonly used data structures

This project is designed as a self-reference module. It provides python 3 implementations of some of the commonly used general purpose data structures. The complexity of methods pertinent to each of the data structures has been aligned to the ADT specifications of the particular data type. This project can be used to build upon for taking interviews in data structures & algorithms. No interview oriented problems have been included in this project to keep the project simple by design and the serve the sole purpose of providing an insight into the design and implementation of general purpose data structures.

For some of the more advanced data types, docstrings have been used to provide the run time specifications of the ADT.
